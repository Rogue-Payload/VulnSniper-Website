    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: October 28, 2024</p>
    <p>Welcome to VulnSniper. This Refund Policy ("Policy") outlines the conditions under which refunds are provided for purchases made on the VulnSniper platform. By using VulnSniper, you agree to the terms specified herein.</p>

    <h2>1. No Refund Policy for Initiated Scans</h2>
    <p>We do not offer refunds for users who have initiated a scan or hacking operation from their VulnSniper dashboard, regardless of whether the scan is completed or still in progress. This policy is in place to prevent misuse, where individuals create accounts, conduct scans, and request refunds, effectively using our platform for free. Once a scan has started, the service is considered to have been fully utilized, and no refund will be issued under any circumstances.</p>

    <h2>2. No Refunds for False Positives</h2>
    <p>VulnSniper, like any cybersecurity tool, cannot guarantee 100% accuracy without any false positives. While our platform uses advanced AI and ML techniques to minimize false positives, it is not feasible to guarantee their complete elimination. As such, requests for refunds due to the presence of false positives in the report are not acceptable and will be denied. VulnSniper is designed to provide a thorough analysis, and users are encouraged to verify findings independently as part of their testing process.</p>

    <h2>3. Eligible Refund Conditions</h2>
    <p>Refunds may be requested under the following limited conditions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Unused Account:</b> If a user has registered an account but has not initiated any scans, they may be eligible for a refund. Users may update their profile information, but as long as no scans have been conducted, a refund can be requested within 30 days of the purchase date.</li>
        <li><b>Package Adjustment:</b> If a user has mistakenly purchased the wrong plan and wishes to adjust their package selection (e.g., upgrade or downgrade), a refund for the incorrect package may be provided, and the correct package can be billed accordingly. This must be requested within 14 days of the original purchase.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Requesting a Refund</h2>
    <p>To request a refund, users must contact our support team at <a href="mailto:vulnsniper@globalbughunters.com">vulnsniper@globalbughunters.com</a> with the following details:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Full Name:</b> The name associated with your VulnSniper account.</li>
        <li><b>Email Address:</b> The email used for registration.</li>
        <li><b>Reason for Refund Request:</b> A detailed explanation of the reason for your refund request.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please note that all refund requests will be reviewed, and eligibility will be determined based on the conditions set forth in this Policy. Refunds, if approved, will be processed within 14 business days of approval.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify this Refund Policy at any time to reflect changes in our business practices or legal requirements. Any changes will be posted on this page, and your continued use of VulnSniper constitutes acceptance of the updated Policy. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Information</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Refund Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:vulnsniper@globalbughunters.com">vulnsniper@globalbughunters.com</a>.</p>
