    <h1>Beta Testing Agreement</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: October 28, 2024</p>
    <p>Welcome to the VulnSniper Beta Testing Program. This Beta Testing Agreement ("Agreement") sets forth the terms and conditions that govern your participation in the beta testing of VulnSniper ("Beta Program"). By participating in the Beta Program, you agree to comply with the terms of this Agreement. This document has been meticulously crafted by cybersecurity experts and legal professionals to protect VulnSniper, its intellectual property, and the integrity of the Beta Program.</p>

    <h2>1. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>As a beta tester, you will have access to pre-release versions of VulnSniper, which may include proprietary information, trade secrets, and other confidential data ("Confidential Information"). By participating, you agree to maintain the confidentiality of all information disclosed to you during the Beta Program. You must not share, distribute, or publish any information, screenshots, videos, or findings related to VulnSniper without prior written consent from VulnSniper.</p>

    <h2>2. Scope of Use</h2>
    <p>Your access to VulnSniper as a beta tester is limited to the purpose of testing, evaluating, and providing feedback on the platform. You must not use the platform for any unauthorized purposes, including but not limited to conducting penetration tests on third-party systems, exploiting vulnerabilities, or performing activities outside the agreed-upon scope.</p>

    <h2>3. Payment Requirements</h2>
    <p>Participation in the Beta Program requires the maintenance of an active, paid subscription to VulnSniper. Beta testers are required to remit a payment for services in addition to their primary account. This fee helps ensure the proper functioning of the Beta Program and offsets the additional resources dedicated to providing beta access. VulnSniper reserves the right to modify payment terms at its discretion.</p>

    <h2>4. Feedback and Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>By participating in the Beta Program, you agree to provide feedback, including but not limited to bug reports, feature suggestions, and usability insights (collectively referred to as "Feedback"). You agree that all Feedback provided by you becomes the exclusive property of VulnSniper. VulnSniper shall have the right to use, modify, and incorporate Feedback into its products without any obligation or compensation to you.</p>

    <h2>5. No Warranty</h2>
    <p>The pre-release versions of VulnSniper are provided "as is," without warranty of any kind. VulnSniper disclaims any and all warranties, whether express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Participation in the Beta Program is at your own risk, and VulnSniper is not liable for any damages or losses arising out of or related to your participation.</p>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>In no event shall VulnSniper be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, revenue, profits, or use, arising out of or related to this Agreement or your participation in the Beta Program, even if VulnSniper has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

    <h2>7. Termination</h2>
    <p>VulnSniper reserves the right to terminate your participation in the Beta Program at any time and for any reason. Upon termination, you must immediately cease using the pre-release version of VulnSniper and delete any copies or related Confidential Information in your possession.</p>

    <h2>8. Compliance with Laws</h2>
    <p>As a participant in the Beta Program, you agree to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines. This includes, but is not limited to, laws regarding data privacy, cybersecurity, and intellectual property. Unauthorized use of VulnSniper in a manner that violates any law or regulation is strictly prohibited and may result in immediate termination from the Beta Program.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to this Agreement</h2>
    <p>VulnSniper reserves the right to modify or update this Agreement at any time. You will be notified of any changes, and your continued participation in the Beta Program constitutes acceptance of the revised Agreement.</p>
